# Analysis of CrebA mutant scRNA-seq and CrebA ChIP-seq 
This repository contains the analysis code for our [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.12.659381v1.abstract). The code base for the analysis of the scRNA-seq can be found in [*analysis*](/analysis/) folder. Before running the analysis code, download the zip file from [here]() and unzip the content into a directory called `quantification`. 

The code base for the analysis of ChIP-seq and scRNA-seq integration can be found in [*CrebA_ChIP_Analysis*](/CrebA_ChIP_Analysis/).
