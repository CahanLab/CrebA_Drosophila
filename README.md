We want to know:

- What genes are regulated by Rib in trachea vs salivary gland (SG)?
- If they are different, as we expect from prior ChIP, why are they different?
- What range of growth strategies are regulated by Rib? 

In pursuit of these questions, this folder analyzes scRNA-seq of whole embryos at stages 13-16.
